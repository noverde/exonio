# Exonio

This gem brings some useful Excel formulas to Ruby. For now, it just has
financial formulas, but could have more (like statistical formulas) in the future.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'exonio'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install exonio

## Usage

To use Exonio you just have to call the method you like to use. Example:

```ruby
 Exonio.pmt(0.075 / 12, 12 * 15, 200_000) # ==> -1854.0247200054619
```

## Available Formulas

### EFFECT

The Excel EFFECT function returns the effective annual interest rate, given a nominal interest rate and the number of compounding periods per year. 
Effective annual interest rate is the interest rate actually earned due to compounding.
More about this function [EFFECT](https://exceljet.net/excel-functions/excel-effect-function)

```ruby
Exonio.effect(0.05, 10 * 12) # ==> 0.05126014873337037
```

### FV

What is the future value after 10 years of saving $100 now, with
an additional monthly savings of $100 with the interest rate at
5% (annually) compounded monthly?

```ruby
Exonio.fv(0.05 / 12, 10 * 12, -100, -100) # ==> 15692.928894335748
```

By convention, the negative sign represents cash flow out (i.e. money not
available today).  Thus, saving $100 a month at 5% annual interest leads
to $15,692.93 available to spend in 10 years.

### IRR

Suppose one invests 100 units and then makes the following withdrawals at regular (fixed)
intervals: 39, 59, 55, 20. Assuming the ending value is 0, one's 100 unit investment
yields 173 units; however, due to the combination of compounding and the periodic
withdrawals, the "average" rate of return is neither simply 0.73/4 nor (1.73)^0.25-1.

```ruby
Exonio.irr([-100, 39, 59, 55, 20]) # ==> 0.28095
```

So, the internal rate of return is 28.09%

### IPMT

What is the interest part of a payment in the 8th period (i.e., 8th month),
having a $5,000 loan to be paid in 2 years at an annual interest rate of 7.5%?

```ruby
Exonio.ipmt(0.075 / 12, 8, 12 * 2, 5_000.00) # ==> -22.612926783996798
```

So, in the 8th payment, $22.61 are the interest part.

### NPER

If you only had $150/month to pay towards the loan, how long would it take
to pay-off a loan of $8,000 at 7% annual interest?

```ruby
Exonio.nper(0.07 / 12, -150, 8000) # ==> 64.07334877066185
```

So, over 64 months would be required to pay off the loan.

### NPV

Calculates the Net Present Value of an investment

```ruby
Exonio.npv(0.281, [-100, 39, 59, 55, 29]) # ==> -0.00661872883563408
```

### PMT

What is the monthly payment needed to pay off a $200,000 loan in 15
years at an annual interest rate of 7.5%?

```ruby
Exonio.pmt(0.075 / 12, 12 * 15, 200_000) # ==> -1854.0247200054619
```

In order to pay-off (i.e., have a future-value of 0) the $200,000 obtained
today, a monthly payment of $1,854.02 would be required.  Note that this
example illustrates usage of `fv` (future value) having a default value of 0.

### PV

What is the present value (e.g., the initial investment) of an investment
that needs to total $20,000.00 after 10 years of saving $100 every month?
Assume the interest rate is 5% (annually) compounded monthly.

```ruby
Exonio.pv(0.05 / 12, 12 * 10, -100, 20_000) # ==> -2715.0857731569663
```

By convention, the negative sign represents cash flow out (i.e., money not available today).
Thus, to end up with $20,000.00 in 10 years saving $100 a month at 5% annual
interest, an initial deposit of $2715,09 should be made.

### RATE

Suppose you take a loan of $50,000.00 to pay in 3 years with a monthly payment of $2,500.00.
What is the rate applied to this loan?

```ruby
Exonio.rate(12 * 3, 2_500, -50_000) # ==> 0.036006853458478955
```

So, the rate applied is 3.60%.

## Statistical formulas

### Sum
```ruby
Exonio.sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) # ==> 15
```
### Mean
```ruby
Exonio.mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) # ==> 3.0
```
### Median
```ruby
Exonio.median([1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4]) # ==> 3.5
```

## Special Thanks

A special thanks goes to the python [NumPy project](http://www.numpy.org/), which was the source for most
of the formulas.
